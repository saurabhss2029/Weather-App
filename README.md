🌐 Tech Stack
This weather app is built with a simple yet powerful combination of technologies to make the user experience smooth and responsive:

HTML: The backbone of the app. It structures everything, from the search bar to the weather data display. It ensures the content is presented cleanly and logically.
CSS: Adds style and personality! With CSS, the app looks polished and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience across different devices.
JavaScript: The magic that makes everything come alive. JavaScript interacts with the user, processes data, and fetches real-time weather details from the weather API.
Weather API: We use the OpenWeatherMap API (or another weather API) to retrieve real-time weather data. This API provides up-to-date weather info for any city, making the app dynamic and accurate.

🔧 How It Works
Here’s how the app works, step by step, to give you real-time weather updates:

Enter City Name:
You simply type the name of any city into the search bar. You don’t need to be a weather expert, just the name will do!

Click "Get Weather":
Hit the button, or press Enter, and watch the app spring into action.

Fetching Data:
In the background, JavaScript sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API (or whichever weather service you’re using) to fetch the weather data for the city you entered.

Processing and Displaying:
Once the API responds with the weather data, the app processes the information and updates the page in real-time. You’ll see all the weather details you need, from temperature to wind speed, right in front of you.
